# WorkGraphsHelloWorkGraphs

HelloWorkGraph is a minimal, "Hello World"-style sample for [D3D12 Work Graphs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/d3d12-work-graphs-preview/). The goal of this sample is to provide a short, single source file which sets up the minimum required in order to exercise a very simple work graph and demonstrate that it behaves correctly.

This example is intended for people already familiar with DirectX 12. If you are not already comfortable with DirectX 12, you may wish to [learn more](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directx-12-ultimate-getting-started-guide/) before continuing.

More information about getting started with D3D12 Work Graphs is available on [GPUOpen](https://gpuopen.com/learn/gpu-work-graphs/gpu-work-graphs-intro/). The code from this sample for setting up a work graph is discussed in the [Getting Started](https://gpuopen.com/learn/gpu-work-graphs/gpu-work-graphs-part1/) section.
